# This file gets included by the Makefile in this directory to determine
# the files that should go only into source distributions.
# The files listed here are sorted in alphanumerical order.  This is
# necessary but if it keeps like this the files are also compiled in
# alphabetical order.
#
# The support subdirectories (crlf, lattice, purec and sozobon) are
# handled in the Makefile.
