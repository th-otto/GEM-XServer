NAME
    a64l, l64a - convert between long integer and base-64 ASCII string

SYNOPSIS
    #include <support.h>
    long a64l(const char *s);
    char *l64a(long l);

DESCRIPTION
    These functions are used to maintain numbers stored in base-64
    ASCII characters. This is a notation by which long integers
    can be represented by up to six characters; each character
    represents a "digit" in a radix-64 notation.
    
    The characters used to represent "digits" are . for 0, / for 1,
    0 through 9 for 2-11, A through Z for 12-37, and a through z
    for 38-63.
    
    a64l takes a pointer to a null-terminated base-64 representation
    and returns a corresponding long value. If the string pointed to
    by s contains more than six characters, a64l will use the first
    six. a64l scans the character string from left to right, decoding
    each character as a 6 bit radix-64 number. If the string contains
    illegal characters, -1 is returned and errno is set to EBADARG.
    
    l64a takes a long argument and returns a pointer to the
    corresponding base-64 representation. If the argument is 0, a64l
    returns a pointer to a null string. If the argument is smaller
    than zero, a pointer to a null string is returned and errno is
    set to EBADARG.

CAVEATS
    The value returned by l64a is a pointer into a static buffer,
    the contents of which are overwritten by each call.
    
    The value returned by a64l may be incorrect if the value
    is too large; for that reason, only strings that resulted
    from a call to l64a should be used to call a64l.

    Maybe these calls should unsigned long values, but longs are
    used here to retain compatibility with UN*X System V.
