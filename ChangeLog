2001-09-21: 0.14
   - if the server can't load its RSC file the normal way, it also
     searches in /usr/X11/bin/ now.
   - added output buffer boundary check to event generating functions
     too, if lots of events happend the server was still crashing.
   - corrected calculation of output stream buffer, was taken too big.
   - some internal code tidy ups.
2001-09-18: 0.13.3
   - heaviely reworked handling of output stream buffer to avoid
     crashes due to buffer overflows, especially in GetImage and
     ListFonts request.
   - speeded up Get/PutImage request for color depth >= 16bit.
   - corrected drawing of window decor (border).
2001-09-13: 0.13.2
   - closed a memory leakage in GetImage request.
   - added a workaround for xoring monochrome bitmaps to a bitmap of
     >= 16bit color depth, to go round a bug in NVDI.
   - corrected return pixel values of 8bit packed pixel bitmaps.
2001-09-08: 0.13.1
   - implemented GetImage request.  now xmag (screen magnifier) and
     the 'AutoGrab Window' function of xv are working.
   - corrected RGB return values of QueryColors request, only the
     first value was set before.
   - changed colormap return value of GetWindowAttributes request to
     the default colormap, workaround for xv's 'AutoGrab Window'
     function.

2001-09-05: 0.13
   - implemented support for 16/24/32 bits color depth graphic modes.
   - fixed a tricky bug which was responsible for white drawings over
     white background on graphic depths >= 16 bits.
   - fixed a bug which crashes the AES if a client tryes to change the
     root window (desktop) background.
2001-09-02: 0.12.4
   - implemented support for Falcon HighColor graphic mode.
   - uses now a static VDI color map to speed up some color related
     requests and colormap changing.
   - always unload fonts of closed offscreen bitmaps if necessary, was
     sometimes forgotten before.
2001-08-27: 0.12.3
   - corrected handling of ServerUngrab request.
   - fixed a bug which caused the server hanging in an infinite loop
     while working off a WM_ONTOP event.
   - reset mouse pointer to normal GEM form if last X window is
     closed.
   - corrected handling of SIGCHLD in connection with xconsole.
2001-08-24: 0.12.2
   - fixed a bug which caused crashes after activating the built-in
     window manager.
   - avoid processes started by the server from becoming zombies after
     termination.
   - some smaller speed improvements.
2001-08-22: 0.12.1
   - fixed a bug in the calculation of clipping rectangels (clip-by-
     children mode) which was responsible for occasional undrawn
     window parts.
   - moved some spezialized AES/VDI call functions to the gemlib to
     use the optimized trap interfaces.  code adapted to the new
     gemlib version 0.42.

2001-07-31: 0.12
   - updated and expanded README and Xg.hyp files.  The Xg.hyp now
     contains also the manpages for xconsole and xmodmap.
   - if the built-in window manager get activated manually after a
     server reset or automatically at startup, xmodmap will be tried
     to be started to apply user defined keyboard and/or mouse button
     mappings (see Xmodmap.EXMPL file).
   - improved performing of server reset with respect to the built-in
     window manager (pseudo client).
   - implemented ChangeKeyboardMapping request and MappingNotify
     event.  this makes it possible to change the keyboard mapping
     for user's purpose, normally done with the 'xmodmap' tool.
   - implemented QueryKeymap request.
   - implemented UnmapSubwindows request, was simply forgotten in
     prior releases.
2001-07-27: 0.11.2
   - implemented GetKeyboardControl request for clients that want to
     know which keys has auto repeat enabled, like xkeycaps does.
   - improved handling of ALT+numblock inputs, nearly all characters
     defined in the Atari font can be typed in this way now.
   - completely reworked keyboard mapping (again), should be working
     now correctly with milan keyboards also, finally.
2001-07-16: 0.11.1
   - implemented GrabServer/UngrabServer requests.
   - reworked socket stream handling.  using an unified call interface
     for both accept and normal io events reduces the cpu usage of the
     server by aprox. 10% in standby.
   - changed gemlib trap interface to asm inline (not completed yet).
     this improves very little the binary size and gem calling speed
     but wasn't really worth the effort.

2001-07-13: 0.11
   - if the server starts up and founds that there is no console installed (or
     opened) it tryes to start xconsole instead.  this works only in case that
     the xconout2.xdd is installed.
   - created another latin 1 gdos-font '6x10' (in gdos-X-fonts-03.tgz), as
     beloved by xconsole and xterm.
   - implemented AV_START message handling to allow client programms to be
     started with corrected command lines.
   - implemented command line conversion from tos to unix path convention for
     client execution.  this makes it possible to start client programs simply
     from the desktop, where file parameters for the client are always given
     in dos convention.
2001-07-08: 0.10.3
   - fixed a stupid bug from last release which stopped window resizing due to
     not taking over the mouse control.
   - improved arguments for executing of client processes.  therefor windows are
     named correctly now, even if clients are started from desktop.
2001-07-07: 0.10.2
   - completely reworked keyboard mapping, should now work correctly with
     different keyboard layouts, also for french and swedish.  Additional,
     mostly can be made use of inputs done by ALT+numblock.
   - improved KeyRelease events timing, will simply be generated after the
     keyboard's initial repeat time expired.
   - re-activated Ctrl+Alt+Backspace for imediate server shutdown, was removed
     by accident.
   - fix a bug which caused the AES to freeze if one mouse button was pressed
     while another was still down.
2001-07-05: 0.10.1
   - corrected calculation of mouse pointer watching rectangle to avoid errors
     on occluded window regions.  this gets rid of problems with knews's sliders
     and xv's load/save box.

2001-07-04: 0.10
   - added new control:  holding down the ALT key and pressing the left mouse
     button somewhere inside a X window allows to move this window, same as is
     handled by other X servers.  Additional there is a "magnetic snap" at the
     desktop borders while moving this way to make window positioning easier.
     a short mouse click into a window instead tops/bottoms this.
   - changed window decoration to view if a window is normally resizeable or
     not.
   - improved window (un)topping, should now always react as expected.
2001-07-01: 0.09.4
   - activated the 'About' box (as wished by lp_ and other :-) ) to display the
     version number.
   - heavyly reworked management of window properties to make the built-in
     window manager's accesses to ICCC values easier and speeds it up a bit.
   - adapted to gemlib 0.41.
2001-06-23: 0.09.3
   - fixed ReparentWindow() handling for setting to root parent.
   - implemented wmgr notification for WM_HINTS properties changes to allow
     clients to update the bitmap of a iconifyed window (as xv does while
     working).  same done for icon window names.
   - decreased debug output a bit.
2001-06-23: 0.09.2
   - improved a bit the detection of gray scale colors for better matching the
     client's ideas of colors using the 4x8x4 color model.
   - release pointer grab if the grab window becomes unmapped, not doing so may
     freeze the system.
   - corrected handling for (un)iconifying windows and several internal changes.
2001-05-21: 0.09.1
   - improved keyboard focus tracking, now apart from iconified windows.

2001-05-18: 0.09
   - changed handling of keyboard focus, X programs should now behave exactely
     as the X core protocol defines as default.
2001-05-17: 0.08.4
   - fixed an ugly bug which caused random crashes after a window has been
     backdropped due to messing up list pointers.
   - change BV_EVENT flag while un/iconifying windows to allow topping by user
     of iconifyed windows also.
2001-05-15: 0.08.3
   - fixed bug in calculating of clipping rectangles by child windows.
2001-05-10: 0.08.2
   - added clip-by-children mode to draw functions to prevent from errorneous
     drawing of obscured window regions.
   - corrected calculation of window's outer border (was 2 pixel too wide), this
     avoids some unnecessary redraws.
2001-05-08: 0.08.1

     windows.

     glitches of gtk+-linked clients.
2001-04-12: 0.07.2
   - implemented improvised reply for GetFontPath() request.
   - workarounds for wrongly gtk+ requests:

     - accept illegal copy requests for source and destination with different
       color depth.
2001-04-02: 0.07.1
